# Enhanced Budget Allocation Application

## Introduction
This project is an Enhanced Budget Allocation Application built with React. The application allows users to allocate budgets to different departments, validate the budget allocations, edit the budget values, and change the currency for budget representations.

## Features
1. **Budget Allocation Validation**: Ensures that only number values are accepted and that the allocation does not exceed the remaining budget.
2. **Editable Budget Value**: Allows users to increase or decrease the budget value by 10, with an upper limit of 20,000.
3. **Currency Dropdown**: Provides options to change the currency to $ Dollar, £ Pound, € Euro, and ₹ Rupee.
4. **Currency Prefixes**: Displays currency prefixes in the Change Allocation textbox and the Budget Value textbox.
5. **Dynamic Currency Change**: Updates all currency representations across the application when the currency dropdown value is changed.
6. **Increase and Decrease Buttons**: Adds buttons to increase or decrease the budget allocation for each department by 10.
